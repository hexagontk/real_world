# REAL WORLD BACKEND

Real World demo is a "Conduit" like application. Conduit is a social blogging site (i.e. a
Medium.com clone). It uses a custom API for all requests, including authentication. You can view a
live demo over at https://demo.realworld.io

General functionality:

* Authenticate users via JWT (login/sign-up pages + logout button on settings page)
* CRU* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
* CRUD Articles
* CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
* GET and display paginated lists of articles
* Favorite articles
* Follow other users

## Architecture

The code has multiple classes per file, not like Java to take advantage of Kotlin language and keep
things short.

`routes` package holds the controllers, called that way because another kind of controllers
(ie: commands for CLI) could exist (in this case a package called `commands` would be created).

The `messages` package contains the request/responses sent to controllers. It is left aside as it
would be eventually shared with the front-end.

Common handling logic (as error processing) is held in `Routes.kt`.

The service has three layers:

* Routes: HTTP layer (controllers) and messages (requests/responses)
  1. Gets data and parameters
  2. Authorize
  3. Authenticate
  4. Validate data and state
  5. Convert to services model
  6. Uses services for validation and execution
  7. Take resulting models and convert them to output messages
* Services: application logic and data (independent of the others)
  - Called by routes
  - Calls stores (the dependency will be by interfaces)
* Stores: storage port (with a MongoDB adapter)

Rules of thumb:

- "All you know binds you" the less each component knows about others, the better.
- Each layer is in a package
- A layer package can have subpackages
- Services can not import anything outside services (except logging)
- Other packages can only import from services not among them

## RealWorld API Spec

* CORS should be working ok and content type must be json/utf8: `application/json;charset=utf8`
* Authenticated endpoints must have the authentication header: `Authorization: Token jwt.token.here`

## JWT

JWT token generation/parsing requires an RSA key pair. To generate a keypair keystore execute:

```bash
keytool \
  -genkeypair \
  -keystore keystore.p12 \
  -storetype pkcs12 \
  -storepass storepass \
  -keyalg RSA \
  -validity 999 \
  -alias realWorld \
  -dname "CN=Real World, OU=Development, O=Hexagon, L=Madrid, S=Madrid, C=ES"
```

## Build

From now on assume `alias gw='./gradlew'`.

* Build: `gw installDist`
* Rebuild: `gw clean installDist`
* Run: `gw run`
* Watch: `gw --no-daemon --continuous runService`
* Test: `gw test`
